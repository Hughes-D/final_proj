My project is going to be a website called "Conservation Connectors" that connects people who are interested in conservation and utilizing our
natural resources responsibly.I chose to do this by allowing users to create new events to meet and do community service acts like park clean 
ups and workshops where people can learn animal husbandry, responsible and sustainable farming and fishing practices, etc. The options that 
can be included in this list are endless!

Features:
A log/reg page with validations
An events page that shows all the upcoming events
An add events page that allows users to create their own events in addition to the Conservation Connectors sponsored events
A page where users can view their own events and edit or delete them
A blog where posts can be made to discuss new conservation events and share pictures and stories from past events.
Users can edit their own comments on the blog page

Nice-to-have:
Admins are only users who can post to blog 
All users can comment on a blog
An API that can display a map and directions of where events will take place
